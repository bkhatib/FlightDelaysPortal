# 🎉 Flight Delays Portal - Project Summary

## ✅ Project Status: **COMPLETE & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

Your Flight Delays Portal is now fully functional with **partition optimization** and ready to deploy to Streamlit Cloud!

## 📊 What We Built

A comprehensive Streamlit application that connects to AWS Athena and provides:

### 🔍 **Advanced Filtering Capabilities**
- **Date Range**: Filter by departure date from/to (**partitioned column for optimal performance**)
- **Journey Type**: International (INT) or Domestic (DOM) flights
- **Origin/Destination**: Filter by airport codes
- **Flight Code**: Search by flight code
- **Departure Delays**: 5 ranges (< 15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90, > 90 minutes)

### 📈 **Data Features**
- **189,117 rows** of flight delays data
- **Sortable columns** (especially by `order_c`)
- **Real-time queries** to AWS Athena
- **Responsive UI** with modern design
- **Partition optimization** for better performance and cost efficiency

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Partition-Aware Queries**
- ✅ **Partitioned Column**: `departure_date` is partitioned for optimal performance
- ✅ **Query Optimization**: Date filters applied first to leverage partition pruning
- ✅ **Cost Reduction**: Only scans relevant partitions, reducing Athena costs
- ✅ **Faster Queries**: Recent data queries are significantly faster

### **Smart Data Loading**
- ✅ **Recent Data Focus**: Unique value queries limited to recent data (30 days)
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Recent 7-day sample data for quick previews
- ✅ **Summary Statistics**: 90-day summary for overview metrics
- ✅ **Caching**: Results cached for 10 minutes to reduce repeated queries

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS
- **Backend**: Python with boto3 for AWS Athena
- **Database**: AWS Athena (eu-west-1 region)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud ready
- **Optimization**: Partition-aware query optimization

### **Key Files**
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application with partition optimization
- `athena_connector.py` - AWS Athena connection handler with partition-aware queries
- `config.py` - Configuration with environment variables
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### **AWS Setup**
- **Account**: edl-prod (032862061730)
- **Role**: edl-prod-de-full-access
- **Region**: eu-west-1
- **Database**: l1_almosafer
- **Table**: fact_flight_delay_scheduler

### **Data Schema**
```sql
Columns: join_key, flight_code, origin, destination, dep_delayed, 
         cal_dep_delayed_minutes, scheduled_departure_date_time_utc, 
         actual_departure_date_utc, journey_type, order_c, 
         selling_price_sum, gbv_sum, departure_date (PARTITIONED)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### **Local Testing** ✅

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- ✅ Environment variables for credentials
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Query optimization with partition pruning

## 📈 Performance & Cost Optimization

### **Query Performance**
- ✅ **Partition Pruning**: Only scans relevant date partitions
- ✅ **Filter Optimization**: Date filters applied first for maximum efficiency
- ✅ **Caching**: Results cached for 10 minutes
- ✅ **Smart Limits**: Recent data queries for better performance

### **Cost Management**
- ✅ **Reduced Data Scans**: Partition filtering minimizes data scanned
- ✅ **Efficient Queries**: Optimized query structure reduces Athena costs
- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: Reduces repeated expensive queries
- ✅ **Date Range Limits**: Encourages users to specify date ranges

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Connection**: AWS Athena working
- ✅ **Data Access**: 189,117 rows retrieved
- ✅ **Filters**: All filtering options functional with partition optimization
- ✅ **UI**: Modern, responsive interface
- ✅ **Performance**: Partition-aware queries for optimal performance
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Reduced Athena costs through partition pruning
- ✅ **Deployment**: Ready for Streamlit Cloud
